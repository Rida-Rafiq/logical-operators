# Student Grading System in C

This is a simple C program that assigns grades to students based on their marks.  
It demonstrates the use of **logical operators** (`&&`, `||`) and **conditional statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`) in C.

## Features
- Takes student's marks as input.
- Assigns grades from **A+** to **F**.
- Uses both AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators for multiple condition checks.
- Handles special mark values like 89, 79, 69, 59, and -1 for demonstration.

## Grade Criteria
| Marks Range           | Grade |
|-----------------------|-------|
| 90 - 100 OR 89        | A+    |
| 80 - 89 OR 79         | A     |
| 70 - 79 OR 69         | B     |
| 60 - 69 OR 59         | C     |
| 0 - 59 OR -1          | F     |
| Otherwise             | Invalid Marks |
